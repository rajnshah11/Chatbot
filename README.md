### Disease Predictor Chatbot
## Overview
The Disease Predictor Chatbot is a web-based application designed to predict general diseases based on user-provided symptoms. This tool helps users identify potential illnesses, offers immediate suggestions, recommends relevant specialists, and locates nearby hospitals. The chatbot leverages machine learning models to analyze user input and deliver accurate predictions, facilitating quicker access to healthcare information.

## Motivation
In many cases, individuals may find it challenging to consult a doctor immediately due to time constraints, costs, or geographical barriers. The Disease Predictor Chatbot addresses this issue by offering a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible solution. By predicting diseases based on symptoms, this tool provides users with valuable insights into their health conditions, helping them make informed decisions about seeking medical care.

## Problem Definition and Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to develop an interactive chatbot capable of predicting diseases and providing relevant information to the user. The specific objectives include:

## Accurate Disease Prediction: Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms.
Efficiency: Minimize unnecessary medical checkups by offering reliable predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: Design an interactive and easy-to-use chatbot that enhances user experience.
Local Hospital Information: Provide users with a list of nearby hospitals.

## Project Scope & Limitations
## Scope
Disease Prediction: The chatbot allows users to input their symptoms, answer related questions, and receive a probable diagnosis along with immediate suggestions and doctor recommendations.
Nearby Hospitals: The application helps users find hospitals in their vicinity.

## Limitations
Genetic and Disease History: The chatbot does not consider the userâ€™s genetic history or previous illnesses, which could impact the accuracy of predictions.
Continuous Learning: The current model does not support continuous learning from new data, meaning it may not improve over time without manual updates.

## Methodologies
The Disease Predictor Chatbot is implemented using the following technologies:
Dialogflow: A natural language processing (NLP) platform by Google, used to create the chatbot interface. Dialogflow interprets user input and generates contextually relevant responses.
Machine Learning Models: The prediction engine is powered by machine learning techniques, such as Decision Trees, which have shown higher accuracy in disease prediction tasks.
Kommunicate Integration: The chatbot interface is integrated with Kommunicate, which provides a customizable UI and enhances the overall user experience.
React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React.js is used to develop the front-end of the application, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user experience.

## Usage
Access the application through your web browser.
Input your symptoms into the chatbot.
Receive a probable disease diagnosis along with suggestions and doctor recommendations.
Find nearby hospitals based on your location.
